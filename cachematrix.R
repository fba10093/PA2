## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a speach "matrix"
## that can cache its inverse. It allows for the:  
## setting of the value of the matrix
## getting of the value of the matrix
## setting of the value of the matrix inverse
## getting of the value of the matrix inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
  
  
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been 
## calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve 
## should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
## Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the 
## solve function in R. 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
  
}
